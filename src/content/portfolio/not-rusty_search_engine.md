# <center> Not-rusty search engine</center>

This is the basic search engine that was written in rust. It's my first programm written in rust, so any criticism is welcomed!

Feel free to send me an advice on how to make my code cleaner and more optimised!

1. Create a dir and put inside of it some html files
2. Run the programm (Usage - <code>cargo run <dir_with_html_files> <search_query></code>)
3. Profit!!!
