For me it's a beautifull day outside(minus really cold temperature(and a snow))) and I hope you have just as wonderfull day as I do.

I've figured out it's a good time to "conclude" my winter holiday.

1. What have I done?
2. Have I learned something usefull?
3. Have I enjoyed my holiday?

## <center>What have I done on my vacation?</center>

Not a lot tbh.
1. I published my website and my portfolio on github.
2. I've started to learn RUST.
3. I looked up a lot of universities.
4. I went to a party on a New Year's Eve.(there will be a follow up on this in this post)

Not gonna lie, but I think - my website is supper cool and I'm proud of myself! I tried to use as little JS as possible(N0NE) while making it. I honestly hate all personal websites that are supper bloated - like the ones which use a lot of: parralax, 3d objects and other JS crap. 

### I HECKIN' hate them!

## <center>RUST</center>

Yep. The RUST programming language.

The why-tf-is-syntaxis-is-worse-than-c++ language or the why-tf-I-must-allways-convert-from-str-to-String language

NGL(not gonna lie), I don't know why it's the most loved language, like, it's a good language, but I wouldn't call it my favourite language(It's the GO lang, my beloved :)).

## <center>The universities</center>

It's my last year of high school, so I have to pick a good university to get a somewhat good degree.

## <center>New Year's Eve party!</center>

Or how it feels to get 3 hours of sleep and the worst hangover of my life.

Yep. Midnight. Me celebrating my New Year's Eve with my family members. My parents decided to pour me some champagne. I drank it.
I drank another glass. My parents' friends called, and my parents went to talk to them. I pour another glass. Started felling a bit tipsy. Went to my room. After 2 hours of sitting in my room, my GF texted me. She invited me to go for a walk with her. I responded - yes. 
After 20 minutes, I was standing at the meeting spot, waiting for her. She came, and we just walked for 30 minutes, talking about stuff. After that, we met our classmate and he invited us to this party. We went to it. There was a lot of people(somewhere about 12). We just started hanging out with them, and I decided to drink a bit(It was another 3 glasses of cheap, white wine(big mistake(gone bad))).

    style="max-width: 720px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10%; margin-bottom: 10%;"></video> </center>

After that we hanged out, until 5 AM. After some time: I and my gf decided to head home(it was a really long walk home). I came home, somewhere around 6 AM. I didn't wake up anybody and just went to sleep. The morning was just AMAZING(no). I woke up 3 hours later, with a huge headache and a hangover :(, and stated programming my project on rust.

There's that. 

Okay, moving forward.

## <center>Have I learned something usefull?</center>

### Yes. Yes, of course.

Rust, how to use github and git program, plus school related stuff.

Not a lot thb. But let's move to the final question - 

## <center>Have I enjoyed my holiday?</center>

# <center>YES!</center>

It was wonderfull. It felt so good to have a little break, and just relax, and have some fun. I hope you enjoyed your holidays, just as much as I did!

Of course, holiday season ends - work starts. Expect a lot of programs to be made and posted here and on my github!

Wish you the BEST!
