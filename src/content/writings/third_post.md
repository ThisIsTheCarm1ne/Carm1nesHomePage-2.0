### TL;DR

# <center>I AM ALIVE!!!!</center>

### End of TL;DR

# <center>Why no posts?</center>

1. Had a lot of stuff to do related to university and school.
2. Started a lot of projects - never finished them
3. Started doing tiktok

# <center>Graduation</center>

I graduated from high school and had to take finals and other activities that are required when graduating. I actually did a pretty good job on the finals and was accepted into a good university.

# <center>A lot of projects - none published</center>

I figured that I should at least post some of the designs I made to illustrate what Iâ€™ve been up to.

<br />

## <center>M00VIES</center>

This web app was intended to be a self-hosted alternative to netflix.

1. You host it somewhere
2. You upload movies to it
3. Then you watch them

Interesting fact: This is the first webapp that I used tailwindcss with.

I am still planing to return to this project in the future.

<br />

## <center>STEP.</center>

I wanted to create a website, that could help people create roadmaps for them.

And because, at that time, AI was a super hyped technology, I decided to implement an AI chatbot to help create or extend existing roadmaps.
 
## <center>SKY</center>

For this project, I actually got 2 designs: light and dark theme.

The light one -

style='width: 80%;' />
</center>

And the dark one -

It was meant to be an online code editor, much like onlike version of vscode, but better.

The main point behind this editor was to let people edit code everywhere, anytime, from their phone, tablet, laptop, or PC. They just need an internet connection and they are good to go!

<br />

Of course, I still got some projects that I didn't made any designs. I am planning to return and make all of them in the near future!

# <center>[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@somewhat_real_carm1ne)</center>

<center>An amazing way to attract new people to your brand</center>

I've been doing it for some time now, and videos are easy to make. You can get popular faster than on YouTube.
Btw, here's the link - [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@somewhat_real_carm1ne)

I was struggling to find my style at first, but once I found it, people started watching my videos.

# <center>Future</center>

Well, these last months were interesting. I've grown as a developer(I grinded LeetCode),
 as a designer(actually started using figma, like a boss)
and the most importantly - as a person(better defined my strong and week sides(And I am trying to improve on the week sides))

But now, let's take a look at what I am planning to do in the near future:

1. Finish the project that I am working on right now. I see a lot of potential in this service. 
2. Re-build this website. I got couple of designs in my mind and after I finish my current project - 
I will re-build my website, from ground-up.
2. Prepar for uni.
2. Expend on TikTok, upping in quality and lowering time spend on making videos. 
2. Grind 'Advent of code' and 'LeetCode'.
2. Enter the mobile development field.
2. Found company. 

<br />

<center>Well, that's all for this post.

Big changes comming soon...</center>
